## Archiving Policy

Memory files are archived when they exceed 200 lines. BOSS will:
1. Copy the oldest entries from the active memory file to a new archive file named `[source]-[YYYY-MM].md`
2. Remove the archived entries from the active file
3. Update this index

Archive files are never deleted.
